<p><strong>Risk of loss</strong></p>

<p><strong>Product&nbsp; Properties &amp; Wash care</strong>
</p>
<p>A majority of crazypetals's offerings are made from handloom and handcrafted products. &nbsp;The subtle variations in
    color, texture and finish are intrinsic to hand made products.&nbsp; while striving for the best color properties.
    An irregular weave or print is not a defect - handloom by definition means uncertainty when it comes to uniformity.
</p>
<p>Colors : We have done our best to display as accurately as possible the colors of the products shown on this website.
    However, because the colors you see will depend on your monitor, we cannot guarantee that your monitor's display of
    any color will be accurate.
</p>
<p>Reds and blues tend to run. All garments should be dry cleaned only.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong>Pricing</strong>
</p>
<p>Except where noted otherwise, the List Price displayed for products on our website, whether in Foreign Currency or
    Indian Rupees represents the full price of the product and international shipping charges, unless specified
    otherwise in the Shipping Fees.

    shipping process. For any reason if we are not able to ship you products as per your order, we will intimate you
    electronically and refund the value of the products not available. Any additional Shipping Fees, if applicable, will
    not be refunded.
</p>
<p>Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced. If we discover a mispricing,
    we will do one of the following:
</p>
<p>If an item's correct price is lower than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount and ship you the item.
    If an
                        item's correct price is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact
